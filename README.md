# Desktop-GrayBot
## INSTALLING :
You need Python3 for installing this Bot.  
Also you need to have VLC Media Player installed on your systems for the music playback to work.  
Run the setup.py file to install all dependencies.  
If you chose to install the GUI dependencies -> The bot can be launched from 'main.py'.  
Else the bot can be launched from 'GrayBot.py'  
Most of the execution part after that is self explanatory.  
  
## NOTE : 
You'll need an GENIUS LYRICS API KEY for using the lyrics feature. You can get it from : https://docs.genius.com/#/resources-h1  
After aquiring a key -> Open 'lyrics.py' in an editor and modify line 4 by pasting your api key in place of :  
                        '---YOUR GENIUS API KEY HERE---'
